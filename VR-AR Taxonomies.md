- Terms: VR, AR, XR, MR, extended reality, etc.
- **Ambiguous**
- No industry standard
- Spectrum/continuum vs sets/subsets?
## Apple’s Spectrum of Immersion

## Mixed-Reality Dominant
- Also known as the reality-virtuality continuum
- MR covers spectrum between real-world and VR
- Distinction between AR and AV lies within amount of real-world and VR in the mix

### Augmented Virtuality
- More virtual than real
- Not popular
- Often related to greenscreen technology
### Meta’s Immersive Environments

## Virtual-Reality Dominant
- VR is considered a broad concept that can include AR and MR
- VR is altering reality, reverse engineering human perception and physiology
- Consists of four key components
### Target behaviour
- E.g., climbing, fishing, being in distant places, etc.

### Organism
- Who is being fooled?

### Artificial sensory stimulation
- Tricking the brain or senses into believing
- E.g., Sensorama

### Awareness
- Does the brain know?
- Extremes: 
	- Brain in a vat
	- The Matrix

## xReality Framework
- X is considered an open variable
- VR and AR are separated based on whether at least visual aspects of the physical environment is part of the experience
![[VR-AR Taxonomies-20250307154753133.png]]
### Augmented Reality
- Physical environment, at least visually, **is** part of the experience
#### Local Presence
- The degree to which a user perceives AR content as being here
- **AR continuum:** assisted reality ←→ mixed reality

### Virtual Reality
- Physical environment, at least visually, is **not** part of the experience
#### Telepresence
- The degree to which a user feels present in the virtual rather than the physical environment
- **Atomistic VR:**
	- The quality of the presence is secondary to some other goals(s)
	- E.g., learning anatomy
	- ![[VR-AR Taxonomies-20250307155348297.png]]
- **Holistic VR:**
	- The user’s perception of being in the virtual world supersedes other aspects
	- E.g., experiencing life in the ISS
